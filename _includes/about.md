This is my personal Omnium Artifactorum, from "Omnium", latin for "all" and "artifactorum" meaning "of the craftsmen".

The idea is to showcase all of my projects, regardless of whether or not they are finished or even very advanced at all, as they are all artifacts of my creation.

Truly everything I've ever made that I still have a trace of is here.

I use this space to document my work, share my progress, and reflect on my journey as a developer and artist.
